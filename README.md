## What is here?

You'll find 3 **branches** in this repository, each built using a specific version in Ionic 2's development timeline. Simply use the branches dropdown menu to switch between the one you want.

* **master**: The master branch was the first version of the Ionic 2 side menu tabs. It was released in May 2016, so was based on the state of Ionic 2 at that time. It was written in vanilla Javascript
* **typescript**: Was the typescript version of the **master**, released in August as a result of TypeScript growing on us.
* **2.0-rc.1**: This is the final release candidate for Ionic 2. In this, almost all are stable and ready to rock and roll.
